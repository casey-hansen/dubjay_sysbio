    "Welcome to exam 1! This exam is meant to assess how you're able to use and adapt the skills we've developed in class so far. This is a take-home exam, meaning you are able to complete it outside of class. That also means you are able to use any resources in the slides, textbooks, notes, or interenet to help you complete the exam. The only thin you are not allowed to use is each other - all work must be your own! If you use sources like online forums or AI to complete your exams, you **must** be sure to cite your source. You do that by placing a version of this comment at the bottom of your coding cell:\n",

    "In this exam, you may wish to use mathematical formatting in your text. Markdown uses the same mathematical formatting a LaTeX, which is very easy to find. Some common examples are included here:\n",

    "\n",
    "To have mathematical symbols or variables within the text, you make use of the `$$` symbols. For example `$R$` becomes $R$. For greek letters, you simply use `$\\letter$` or `$\\Letter$` (depending on if you need the capitilized version or not. So `$\\delta$` becomes $\\delta$ and `$\\Delta$` becomes $\\Delta$. Some other useful syntax:\n",
