    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Exam Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "This document is your final exam. It must be submitted at a Quarto-rendered MS Word document. Any written work should be included as a figure within your exam answers (not attached to the end of your exam or as a separate file). \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Citing outside sources\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, it's expected that you will look online for help when you get stuck. If you use any part of an online solution, you need to se sure it is properly cited. That means:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is a in-text citation in the code (`# Code sourced from geeksforgeeks`)\n",
    "* There is formal citation included in a **markdown** cell below the coding cell with the following information\n",
    "    * What website or source you used\n",
    "    * If you used AI, a copy of your query\n",
    "    * If you found a help page or forum, a copy of the article/question title\n",
    "    * A link to your source, if relevant\n",
    " \n",
    "If you do not properly cite your sources in your exam, you will not get credit for your work\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Math in Markdown\n",
    "In this exam, you may wish to use mathematical formatting in your text. Markdown uses the same mathematical formatting a LaTeX, which is very easy to find. Some common examples are included here:\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a centered, formatted equation, use the `$$...$$ ` characters (you must have a blank line above and below). `$$E = mc^2$$` becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E = mc^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To have mathematical symbols or variables within the text, you make use of the `$$` symbols. For example `$R$` becomes $R$. \n",
    "For greek letters, you simply use `$\\letter$` or `$Letter$` (depending on if you need the capitilized version or not. So `$\\delta$` becomes $\\delta$ and `$\\Delta$` becomes $\\Delta$. Some other useful syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Superscripts (^): `$e^{3x}$` $\\rightarrow$ $e^{3x}$\n",
    "* Subscripts (_): `$k_{m+}$` $\\rightarrow$ $k_{m+}$\n",
    "* Right arrow (or left): `$\\rightarrow$` $\\rightarrow$\n",
    "\n",
    "For any other symbols, I recommend the website [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) (or use the Google machine). \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 What if I get too stuck?\n",
    "If your code has an error, your file will not render through `Quarto`. If you genuinely feel you cannot complete a problem, but think you got close to the answer, the best way to submit your work is to comment out the entire code cell (`Ctrl/Cmd + /`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Grading\n",
    "This exam is 125 points, each question its point value clearly defined. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask the professor"
