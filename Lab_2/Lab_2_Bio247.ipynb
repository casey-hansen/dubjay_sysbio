    "# Module 1: Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are a special kind of list in python. They have all of the same features of a list, with one additional benefit - in a list, we generally reference items by their position, or index. In a dictionary, yo uhave the added feature of a *key*, which gives a name to each item in the dictionary. In this way, it acts like you would think of a traditional dictionary, a word (key) with a defintion (value). You define a dictionary in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "    d = {\n",
    "            <key>: <value>,\n",
    "            <key>: <value>,\n",
    "            .\n",
    "            .\n",
    "            .\n",
    "            <key>: <value>,\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "And you reference the values in a dictionary much like you would in a list (using '[]'), but in a dictionary, instead of a numerical index, you call the value by its key.\n",

    "# Module 2 DataFrames\n",

    "The easiest way to think of DataFrames is 'Lists on Steroids' - DataFrames are the Python equivalent of spreadsheets, which in the data world are considered a 2-D data container.

What if you want someone else to use your function, how are they going to know how to use it? That's where Docstring comes in . DocString is a specific type of commenting that's used to create documentation for user-created functions. It has a whole host of properties for creating help menus and professional documentation, but for now it's enough to know that it's a more efficient way of storing information about your function. Let's recreate the above function, only now, let's add the DocString. Look through the below example, and then go back up to your function for task 4.1 and add the DocString (2 point)\n",
