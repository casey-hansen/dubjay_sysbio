    "Think back to the grids we developed to represent the concentration of *A* particles through space for the initial state, and the first time-step. After an additional time step, the particles continue to diffuse outward. For example, each diagonal neighbor of the central cell in the above figure, which has a concentration of 0.05 after one time step, will lose all of its particles in the following step. Each of these cells will also gain 20% of the particles from two of its adjacent neighbors, along with 5% of the particles from the central square (whose concentration is zero). This makes the updated concentration of this cell after two time steps equal to 2(0.2)(0.2) + 0.05(0) = 0.08.\n",

Each such cell will receive 20% of the particles from two of its adjacent neighbors and 5% of the particles from two of its diagonal neighbors, which have a concentration of 0.2. Therefore, the updated concentration of each of these cells after two time steps is 2(0.2)(0.05) + 2(0.05)(0.2) = 0.02 + 0.02 = 0.04.\n",
